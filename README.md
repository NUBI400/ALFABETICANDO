Alfabeticando is an educational game designed to teach young children how to read.
My group was paid to make it in a week for some teenagers to hand in as an educational project for an assessment.

How to play:

On the first level, put letters together to form words.
On the second level, put letters together to form syllables.
On the third level, decipher what each letter means to form a word.
